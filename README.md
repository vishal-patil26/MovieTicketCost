# Movie Ticket Booking System

This is a simple C-based console application that calculates the ticket cost for a movie based on its details, the type of viewing circle (Gold/Silver), and the movie category (2D/3D). The program accepts input from the user and outputs the corresponding ticket cost.

  - Handles invalid inputs for movie category and circle type.

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler such as GCC.
